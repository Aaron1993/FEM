# FEMFEM is a fast and efficient short read mapper. ## UsageCurrently, we provide binaries compiled with gcc 4.8.5 on CentOS 7.2. The source code will be available soon.### Indexing```shFEM-index <window size> <step size> reference.fasta ```### Mapping```shFEM-vl <error threshold> <number of threads> <number of additional q-gram> reference.fasta read.fastq output.sam``````shFEM-g <error threshold> <number of threads> <number of additional q-gram> reference.fasta read.fastq output.sam```## ParametersTo reduce mapping time, we recommend you to use the smallest step size as long as the index can fit into your memory.## ContactsHaowen Zhang <br />Email: hwzhang94@gmail.comWeiguo Liu <br />Email: weiguo.liu@sdu.edu.cnWe welcome any bug report and suggestion.
